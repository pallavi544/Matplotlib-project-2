# Matplotlib-project-2
Project Overview
This project showcases a series of data visualizations created using Python's Matplotlib library. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capability of Matplotlib in generating various types of plots, aiding in the understanding and interpretation of data.

**Visualizations Included:

*The notebook includes the following types of plots:

*Line Plot: Illustrates trends over a period or continuous data.

*Bar Chart: Compares different categories or groups.

*Histogram: Shows the distribution of a dataset.

*Pie Chart: Represents parts of a whole.

*Scatter Plot: Displays relationships between two variables.

Each plot is accompanied by appropriate titles, labels, and legends to enhance clarity and comprehension.

**Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.

Matplotlib: The primary library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows for interactive computing.
