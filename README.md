# Matplotlib-project-2
This project is a continuation of visual data exploration using Matplotlib, one of the most popular data visualization libraries in Python. Through a set of well-structured and visually engaging plots, this notebook demonstrates how to use Matplotlib to analyze and present data effectively.

## Objective
* The key goals of this project are to:

* Explore Matplotlib’s flexibility for creating static plots

* Learn how to customize visuals with titles, axis labels, ticks, colors, and legends

* Visualize data distributions, trends, and comparisons

* Practice plotting different types of charts using real or sample data

## Visualizations Included
* The notebook includes:

* Line Plot – Used to display trends over time or continuous values

* Bar Chart – For comparing categorical data

* Pie Chart – For showing proportions of categories

* Scatter Plot – To examine relationships between two numeric variables

* Histogram – For understanding data distribution

* Each plot is styled with appropriate labels, color schemes, and layout adjustments for better readability and presentation.
